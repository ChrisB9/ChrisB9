### Hola ðŸ‘‹

I am Chris, software engineer and freelancer with an emphasis in PHP backend development.  
Additionally, I am engaged in the OSS-Community - e.g translating documentations, building software, or contributing to existing projects. Prior to COVID-19, I attended meetups, conferences, and co-working spaces e.g TYPO3 DevDays.<br />
I currently reside and work remotely in Kiel, Germany. In my spare time I enjoy hiking, travelling, paragliding, or just reading a book and spending time with my wife.
