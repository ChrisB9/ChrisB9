### Hola ðŸ‘‹

I am Chris, software engineer and freelancer with an emphasis in PHP backend development.  
Additionally, I am engaged in the OSS-Community - e.g translating documentations, building software, or contributing to existing projects.  
I currently reside and work remotely in Stuttgart, Germany. In my spare time I enjoy traveling, paragliding, coding, watching tv or just reading a book.
