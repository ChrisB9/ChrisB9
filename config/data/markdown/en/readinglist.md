The following links are books and organizations, in english and german, that either help creating a better future or are giving insight into why we need to change something.  
I am no expert in any of these topics and make lots of mistakes myself here. The reason this page exists, is, that there needs to be as much platform as possible to make a change possible.

The (growing list of) links mostly feature the topics of racism/discrimination and climate crisis.

### Organizations and websites

### books, must reads:

Germany has a ton of issues - many of which are not discussed enough.  
This section lists only german resources.

I am always searching for more literature on these topics here and will adapt this list once I read it.
