## Who am I?

My name is Christian Rodriguez Benthake, a {%-test.html.twig%}-year-old software engineer and freelancer with an emphasis in (PHP) backend development. 
Additionally, I am engaged in the OSS-Community - e.g translating documentations, building software, or contributing to existing projects. Prior to COVID-19, I attended meetups, conferences, and co-working spaces e.g TYPO3 DevDays.<br />
I currently reside and work remotely in Stuttgart, Germany. In my spare time I enjoy hiking, travelling, paragliding, or just reading a book and spending time with my wife and watching K-Drama with her.
<br />

--------------------------------

### My technology stack

Over the years, I have worked with various languages and applications.   
Here is a brief overview:

- PHP, especially modern PHP (>=7.x). e.g. This website is written with the latest PHP 8.2
  - Frameworks: Symfony, ...
  - CMS: PimCore, TYPO3, WordPress
  - Testing: PHPUnit, Codeception, Psalm, phpstan, Rector, ...
  - and plenty more ...
- JavaScript (mainly ES6+)
  - TypeScript
  - Frameworks: React, Vue, alpinejs
- DevOps
  - docker, hetzner cloud
  - webservers: nginx and apache
  - CI/CD: gitlab, bitbucket, github, JetBrains Space
  
I currently am learning `rust`. The PHP 8.0 docker image I created uses rust-lang to build the Dockerfiles based on templates.  
[Learn more about that docker image](https://github.com/ChrisB9/php8-xdebug)  
That docker image can be used for PHP 8.0 in production and development, for nginx and cli usage, and runs on either debian or alpine.

#### What I work with:

- Developing: The entire suite provided by JetBrains, mainly PHPStorm and DataGrip
- VCS: JetBrains Space, gitlab and github
- OS: Since many years on Ubuntu-Linux
- Project-Management: Freelancing: JetBrains Space; Work: Jira
